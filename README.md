For my term project, I'd like to investigate how Black people’s and other people of color's triumphs and contributions have frequently been suppressed, erased, or misattributed in popular history. Many of the innovations, cultural movements, and scientific achievements that impacted the modern world were developed or influenced by nonwhite people, but their tales are largely overlooked. This form of historical censorship not only distorts the past but also influences how people view identity, development, and belonging in the present. My website will include specific examples from various sectors such as science, art, and everyday life. Each segment will focus on a different topic, such as medical improvements, technological innovations, or creative arts, to demonstrate how much has been overlooked in what is generally taught or praised. To make the text more compelling, I intend to include visuals of the individuals being discussed whenever possible, allowing visitors to connect names and faces to their accomplishments. I'd also like to experiment with interactive timelines or, if that's too complicated, a navigation bar arranged by historical periods. This will allow users to explore contributions within specific historical contexts. 

Design will be key in reinforcing the topic. I envisage a background image or subtle textures that reflect the topics being addressed, such as abstract patterns inspired by scientific graphs, artistic brushstrokes, or common cultural motifs. A warm, earthy color scheme (deep browns, golds, and muted blues) would help portray dignity and resilience while maintaining readability and accessibility. The layout will be similar across all pages, with straightforward navigation and space for images, captions, and external links. Some of the obstacles I anticipate include deciding which cases to highlight, given the breadth of contributions. I'll need to perform thorough research to ensure accuracy and prevent oversimplification. I need to find high-quality, copyright-safe photos and multimedia assets to integrate into the website. So far, I've found materials like museum archives, digital history projects, and academic articles that highlight underappreciated efforts. These will serve as the foundation for a continuously updated Works Cited list. 

Ultimately, my goal is to establish a website that promotes awareness, piques curiosity, and provides proper recognition where it has long been denied. I believe I'll need comments on which examples resonate with audiences the most, whether the design choices effectively complement the theme, and how to strike a balance between depth and accessibility for broad readers.
